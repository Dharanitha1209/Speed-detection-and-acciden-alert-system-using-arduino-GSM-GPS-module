The Accident Alert IoT project utilizes Arduino, GPS, and GSM modules to enhance road safety. The system involves a GPS module for real-time location tracking, an accelerometer for accident detection, and a GSM module for communication. The Arduino processes data, and if an accident is detected, it sends emergency alerts with GPS coordinates to predefined contacts. The project aims to provide a quick and automated response in critical situations, contributing to improved road safety by reducing response times and providing accurate location information. Including another Arduino module that detects the speed of the vehicle which crosses between two IR sensors and displays the speed in a LCD display. Also an alarm buzzes if the vehicle exceeds the normal speed.
